* start container on worker nodes
* monitors health and restarts containers
* replicates containers (scales up)
* optimizes utilisation of all nodes
* rolling updates to replace containers with new versions
* provides containers with volumes (and resources)
* provides networking between containers
* bundles access to multiple containers in services (load balancing)

Notes:
* One or multiple servers (nodes) run as Master with the so called control plane
* Control-Plan runs containers of kubernetes which manage the cluster
* Each worker node runs a process managing the containers on it 
* Each worker node runs kube proxy to enable communication between nodes and containers
