## Windows users

* if possible use subsystem for linux shell (bash)
* or use powershell - commands may have to be sligthly adapte (ie. \ )


----

## overall hints

* use `tab` key a lot - autocompletion is installed
* write the commands, don't copy paste
* get used to the commands, you'll use them a lot
