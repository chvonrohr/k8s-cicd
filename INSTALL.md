Thank you for participating in a letsboot.com Kuberentes training.

For everyone:

* fill in our preparation survey: https://letsboot.com/kbprep

## Letsboot Virtual Desktop

* We provide you a completly browser based (Theia) virtual desktop environment with all tools, clusters, configurations, permissions and the course material. 

* The thing you need is a working laptop with Chrome. (On request in advance, we can provide a training laptop.)

## Local setup (Advanced - optional)

If you want to be able to do as much as possible on your local setup, you'll need the following tools.
For beginners we recommend to do the training with our virtual desktop environment.
Contact us if you have any issues or questions about the setup beforehand.

**Important: For "one day" trainings, we can not support local setup issues during the training.**

### Basic local setup

With this setup you can do most of the training locally, and for the google cloud part, you can switch to Theia.

#### Windows:

Disclaimer: There are many ways to install software, we prefere to use chocolately on windows.

Todo: check bash / powershel / ssh on windows...

* docker for desktop - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
* https://chocolatey.org/ - to install commands with choco
* node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
* git - `choco install git`
* ssh - `choco install ssh`
* helm - `choco install helm`
* golang - `choco install golang`
* bash - `choco install bash`
  * you can do everything with powershell, but you need to adapt some commands
* angular - `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* reveal-md - `npm install -g reveal-md` (optional)


#### Mac:

Disclaimer: There are many ways to install software, we prefere to use homebrew on mac.

* docker for desktop - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
* https://brew.sh - to install commands with brew
* git (already installed)
* ssh (already installed) & private / public key
  * add your public key to your gitlab user
* node.js - we recommend: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
* helm - `brew install helm`
* golang - `brew install golang`
* parallel - `brew install parallel` (gnu parallel)
* angular - `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* reveal-md - `npm install -g reveal-md` (optional)

#### Linux:

Please refere to your distributions documentation or package manager.

* docker
* kind - https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
* git
* ssh - including private / public key
  * add your public key to your gitlab user
* node.js - we recommend: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
* helm
* golang
* parallel (gnu parallel)
* angular - `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* reveal-md - `npm install -g reveal-md` (optional)

#### Check your setup

In the terminal the following commands have to be available:

```bash
# these commands have to show a version (we don't have a specific version requirement)
docker --version
kubectl version
helm version
git --version
ssh -V
npm --version
go version

# has to show something like "Kubernetes master is running at"
kubectl cluster-info

# this should start a busybox "linux" shell in docker
# you can leave it with the "exit" command
docker run -it --rm busybox

# this should start a busybox "linux" shell in your current kubernetes context
# you can leave it with the "exit" command
kubectl run -i --tty busybox --image=busybox --rm --restart=Never -- sh
```

If you have issues or questions with this setup contact us: info@letsboot.com

###Â Advanced Setup

If you want to do the remote cluster setup on google in your own environment you also need the following accounts and tools: (We will provide a personal cluster for every participant.)

* google cloud account
* create a google cloud project
* connect billing to your google cloud project
* install google-cloud-sdk - https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install
* authenticate gcloud command with `gcloud login`
* create minimal cluster:

** Important: this will lead to cost. **

```bash
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER-NAME --preemptible --zone europe-west6-a --machine-type e2-small
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME --zone europe-west6-a

# to delete use:
gcloud container clusters delete CLUSTER-NAME
```
