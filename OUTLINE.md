# Why containers

* first was the physical server "blÃ¤ch"
  * multiple applications on one server (database, backend, totally different)
  * shared hosting
  * hardware, monitoring, physical on site management
* then there was virtualisation
* some crazy people did something like "chroot"
* virtualisation
  * you still have to manage and setup operating system
  * ...
* ...

## The software engineer

* my software need xyz libraries, versions, resources, services
* run now
* what does it do, how is it doing
* give it more resources
* here is an update
* update those libraries
* rollout this version
* you don't provide it like this, I have to change my code :-(

## The system engineer

* my systems need to be like this
* keep everything in cycles I can manage
* keep all versions / software which I have to update the same everywhere
* don't use stuff that can mess up my system
* application A must not mess up application B
* what you need this port and that network interface - NO
* why do you need
* you break it, I have to fix it :-(

## hirarchy

cloud (google kubernetes engine)
--> creates clusters and nodes

kubernetes cluster

node-pool

node - underlying virtual machine or server has to be created outside of kubernetes

pod
